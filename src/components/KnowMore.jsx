              The idea of Sri Jodhpurwala sweets was Incorporated in the year
              1994 , when the patriarch of Tiwari family, Mr Shyam Sunder Tiwari
              , decided to changeover from his metal containers business, into
              producing & retailing Sweets & Fast Food. Soon after, the family
              chose to focus on sweets, and hence, "Sri Jodhpurwala sweets" was
              born.
