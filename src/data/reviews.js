    text: "Raj kachori and Jain kachori are very good. They are prepared fresh and batches get sold out quickly so you may need to wait. Sweet chutney served with them are very tasty too. They also serve other snacks like bonda, pakoda and few types of sweets but do not miss kachoris here. This shop is very old and is situated almost in front of Aziz plaza, so you will have to bear with unruly people with no driving, parking and civic sense to get to this place.",
